# Bjoern Buettner

These are the repositories of a small business located in Germany. We strive to provide hosting, development and consulting services for fair prices and high quality.

## What can you expect to find here?

This organisation will contain all open source code, that I write for clients as well as some internal projects, that I write for the services provided. If you want something developed, we offer lower prices for anything open source, since that gives back to the communities that I am part of.
